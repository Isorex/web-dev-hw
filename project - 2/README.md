Part 1
---
Having trouble thinking of an idea
-settled on finger painting

Started with a photo of finger painting
-added dimension controls
```markdown
<img src="http://www.meganmanzi.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/o-finger-painting-facebook.jpg"
 alt="Finger Painting" style="width:px;height:px;">
```
Adding the history of said finger painting
-trying to figure out which words to emphasize
-Paragraph looks decent

Added a viewport to help with scaling issues

Completed base website

ToDo:
Play around with formating and design in future iterations

Recap:
This project was a great learning experience for me in terms of viewport.
I've never added one to my websites before and it makes the page versatile
between different screen dimensions. I've also added image dimension controls
into this website which I've never done before.

Part 2

I had fun creating the form page and messing around with different designs.

The only trouble I had this week was getting my pages to link. It's been awhile since I've used html so it was a good refresher.
