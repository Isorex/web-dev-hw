        <h1>History</h1>
          <p>
            American educator <b>Ruth Faison Shaw</b> is credited with introducing <del>handpainting</del> fingerpainting as an art education medium.
            She developed her techniques in Rome, Italy, before patenting a safe <i>non-toxic</i> paint in 1931.
            After developing her expressive medium for children, Shaw devoted her attention to the therapeutic benefits of finger-painting.
            At the request of Carl Menninger, she taught at the Southard School at the Menninger Foundation in Topeka, Kansas, United States.
            Later she served as a consultant to the Department of Psychiatry at Memorial Hospital at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
            While working at Memorial Hospital, she met psychologist, John Thomas Payne. Payne became her successor in
            1969 and continued her work until his death in 2000. Today Shaw and Payne's work continues at the Shaw School
            and Studio in Durham, NC. Founder and director,<s>Brad</s> Bryan Carey apprenticed with Payne from 1986–1993. At the suggestion
            of Payne, Carey devoted an additional seven years to the study of Shaw as an historical figure—artist, teacher and
            therapist. Carey and his <ins>protégée</ins> Jennifer Falchi continue the Shaw-Payne tradition by traveling and teaching their method of artistic
            self-expression and emotional healing to people of all ages and abilities.<sup>(wikipedia)</sup>
