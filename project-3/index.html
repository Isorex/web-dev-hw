                <p>
                  This book is one of my first memories. My mother used to read this to me before bed and I just remember being totally transported
                  to a different world. One filled with grand landscapes and captivating story lines. I love this book so much that I've read it over twenty times.
                  I'd recommend this book to anyone who appreciates discriptive storytelling where the world is imagined for you.

                      This is one of the most freshly original and delightfully imaginative books for children that have appeared in many a long day.
                      Like "Alice in Wonderland," it comes from Oxford University, where the author is Professor of Anglo-Saxon, and like Lewis Carroll's story,
                       it was written for children that the author knew (in this case his own four children) and then inevitably found a larger audience.
