                  John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (1892-1973) was a major scholar of the English language, specialising in Old and Middle English.
                  Twice Professor of Anglo-Saxon (Old English) at the University of Oxford, he also wrote a number of stories, including most
                  famously The Hobbit (1937) and The Lord of the Rings (1954-1955), which are set in a pre-historic era in an invented version
                  of our world which he called by the Middle English name of Middle-earth. This was peopled by Men (and women), Elves, Dwarves,
                  Trolls, Orcs (or Goblins) and of course Hobbits. He has regularly been condemned by the Eng. Lit. establishment, with honourable
                  exceptions, but loved by literally millions of readers worldwide.

                  In the 1960s he was taken up by many members of the nascent “counter-culture” largely because of his concern with environmental issues.
                  In 1997 he came top of three British polls, organised respectively by Channel 4 / Waterstone’s, the Folio Society, and SFX, the UK’s
                  leading science fiction media magazine, amongst discerning readers asked to vote for the greatest book of the 20th century. Please note
                  also that his name is spelt Tolkien (there is no “Tolkein”). <i>-David Doughan</i>

                    This is one of the most freshly original and delightfully imaginative books for children that have appeared in many a long day.
                    Like "Alice in Wonderland," it comes from Oxford University, where the author is Professor of Anglo-Saxon, and like Lewis Carroll's story,
                     it was written for children that the author knew (in this case his own four children) and then inevitably found a larger audience.
