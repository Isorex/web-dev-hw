              Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design which makes web pages render well
              on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. Recent work also considers the viewer
              proximity as part of the viewing context as an extension for RWD. Content, design and
              performance are necessary across all devices to ensure usability and satisfaction.
              A site designed with RWD adapts the layout to the viewing environment by using fluid,
              proportion-based grids, flexible images, and CSS3 media queries,
              an extension of the @media rule.

              RWD is so important today because of the vast amount of users that have mobile devices.
              Say you are a local business and a good two thirds of your buisness comes from your website.
              If your website can't be viewed on mobile devices than your losing money.
